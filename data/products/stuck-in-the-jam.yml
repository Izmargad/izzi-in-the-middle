  With the wonderful world of JAMstack getting big, all the categories of
  services and tools that help it along are as important as ever. There are
  static site generators, headless CMSs, and static file hosts.




  I think those classifications are handy, and help conversations along. But
  there is a point where nuance is necessary and these classification buckets
  get a little leaky.




  Note, these charts are just intended to paint a spectrum, not to be a
  comprehensive list of services.
