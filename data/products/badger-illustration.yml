  Towards a personal design system, built on core values.


  **Kindness**


  UI Design is not just about mock-ups and requirements. It is opening up tools
  and showing possibilities to users. Good UX Design is about showing kindness.
  It provides a friendly (inter)face to technology. Showing kindness through
  design is the displacing of the ego that likes this colour or font and doesn’t
  like that. It is designing with kindness and compassion to solve problems for
  use cases across systems and modules.


  **Authenticity**


  I can only live my life when I am aware of my intention and subsequent
  purpose. Every decision is steered by my intention and living an authentic
  life means to align one’s true intention with your actions. By living and
  working with authenticity, one looks beyond the obvious and past copy-paste
  solutions.


  **Courageousness**


  It takes courage to say: “I don’t know” – it means that you are not scared to
  show vulnerability. To be truly open to life and new possibilities and
  solutions to problem, one should never stop learning and one should always
  have the courage to say: “I don’t know, can you help me?”


  **Love of learning**


  I am motivated by acquiring new skills and constantly changing and adapting. I
  like to move, and adapt. Life’s meaning is in learning and teaching. It is the
  only way to grow and evolve. The greatest gift from one human being to another
  is to share what you have learnt. You can only prove what you have learnt and
  mastered by teaching. I am always ready to learn, and therefore always
  available to teach.
