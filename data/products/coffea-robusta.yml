  I am motivated by acquiring new skills and constantly changing and adapting. I
  like to move, and adapt. Lifeâ€™s meaning is in learning and teaching. It is the
  only way to grow and evolve. The greatest gift from one human being to another
  is to share what you have learnt. You can only prove what you have learnt and
  mastered by teaching. I am always ready to learn, and therefore always
  available to teach.
