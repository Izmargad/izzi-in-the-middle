  ## Illustration


  > A drawing is simply a line going for a walk. ” A line is a dot that went for
  a walk.” - Paul Klee


  I love to doodle, and once in a while, some doodles, graduate to fully fledged
  SVG artefacts.


  In honor of Paul Klee's take on what a drawing is, or a line, I think my
  illustrations are doodles that studied math and got their act together.
  Sometimes the doodles in all their imperfections can stand alone as art, but
  illustration and sketches are certainly part of my value add and offering
  available to you design.
