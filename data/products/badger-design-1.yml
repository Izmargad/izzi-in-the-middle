  ## Drawing on ideas


  > A line is a dot that went for a walk. - Paul Klee


  I love to doodle, and once in a while, some doodles, graduate to fully fledged
  SVG artefacts.


  In honor of Paul Klee's take on what a drawing is, (a line or point that went
  for a walk), my illustrations are doodles that studied math and got their act
  together. Sometimes the doodles in all their imperfections can stand alone as
  art. The moral of the story, lines and sketches matter.
