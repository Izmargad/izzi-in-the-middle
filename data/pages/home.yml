  title: Design with Kindness
story: >-
  UI Design is not just about mock-ups and requirements. It is opening up tools and showing possibilities to users. Good UX Design is about showing kindness. It provides a friendly (inter)face to technology. Showing kindness through design is the displacing of the ego that likes this colour or font and doesnâ€™t like that. It is designing with kindness and compassion to solve problems for use cases across systems and modules.
